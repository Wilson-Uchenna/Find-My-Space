                <h3>Step 1: Set Your Budget</h3>
                <p>Before you start looking for the right property, first consider what your priorities are – location,
                    number of bedrooms, size of lounge etc and match them against your available budget. Using our
                    finance calcualtor will help you to do this.
                    You can then start looking for the right property that meets your criteria. You can register online
                    with us for property updates. Setting up an online account is a great way to ensure that as soon as
                    any property comes up that matches your criteria you are immediately notified.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Book an appointment to view the house</h3>
                <p>Once you have found a property that you are interested in get in touch with the office to arrange a
                    suitable time for you to view the property. Our website was designed for you to have an easy
                    experience when trying to find the perfect home so the more information you can give them to explain
                    exactly what you are looking for and what is on your wish list will assist them in helping you to
                    find ‘home’.</p>
                <h3>Step 3: Make a decision</h3>
                <p>If you would like to rent a property that you have seen you should then notify us quickly that you
                    would like to rent it out. From a finance perspective make sure that you consider how much the
                    deposit is .</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Complete the paper work</h3>
                <p>Once you have found a property that you are interested in get in touch with us to arrange a suitable
                    time for you to view the property.
                    Our staff are fully trained in helping you find the perfect home so the more information you can
                    give them to explain exactly what you are looking for and what is on your wish list will assist them
                    in helping you to find ‘home’.</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Sign tenant agreement and make the deposit</h3>
                <p>A tenant agreement is then drawn up which details all of the legal and contractual obligations that
                    both you and your landlord must adhere to. It is important that you are familiar with the agreement
                    before you sign it so make sure that you ask for a draft agreement when your application is
                    accepted.
                    The security deposit and the first rental payment is then taken. It is a legal requirement that the
                    tenancy deposit is registered with a Government approved deposit scheme after it has been paid. We
                    have produced a Tenant guide to tenancy deposit protection which explains in simple terms what is
                    required. Before you can move in you must pay the balance of any monies owed such as the first
                    months’ rent, the deposit and any outstanding fees.</p>
                <h3>Step 6: Move In</h3>
                <p>Before you move in the Landlord will have had an inventory prepared. This document describes the
                    condition of the property and anything left behind by the landlord. The inventory is used when you
                    leave the property to ensure that the condition that you leave it in can be fairly assessed against
                    any deposit deductions that may come up.
                    Insurance – your landlord is responsible for insuring the building and their possessions but you may
                    want to take out your own contents insurance. </p>
